HelpCommands ["HELP","TYPE","FIND","MON","PLAY","REC","ATTN","CONF","MEDIA","MUTE"]
```

Run the `info` command:
```
λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand <ip address> <port> $ info
Info ["Labsat Wideband","Serial 57082 ","Firmware 1.0.260","FPGA 33","IP 10.1.22.44","Battery not connected","TCXO-0x7b7f"]
```

Run the play command, check status, stop playing, check status:
```
λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ play "File_001"
"File_001"

λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ playStatus
Playing "File_001" "00:00:03"

λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ playStop
"OK"

λ: runCtx $ runStatsCtx $ testCommand  <ip address> <port> $ playStatus
